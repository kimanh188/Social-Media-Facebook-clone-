# SocialBook

This project serves as a personal sandbox for honing my HTML, CSS (with Sass), and JavaScript skills as I embark on my web development journey. Over the span of 2.5 months, I've dedicated time to building foundational concepts and implementing practical elements.

## Learning Objectives

- **HTML & CSS Mastery**: Practice and refine skills in structuring web content and styling it effectively, incorporating Sass.
- **Sass Implementation**: Explore the power of Sass for more maintainable and modular stylesheets.
- **Introduction to JavaScript**: Develop fundamental JavaScript skills through the creation of a theme toggle feature.

## Tutorial Source

This project was developed alongside the tutorial from the [GreatStack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NljIHlZRTTE&ab_channel=GreatStack) YouTube channel. The design and structure closely follow the tutorial, including the use of the SocialBook logo. However, I've made the following modifications and additions:

- **Custom Images**: While the overall design and logo are based on the tutorial, I've used my own images sourced independently.

- **Sass Implementation**: Instead of plain CSS, I opted for Sass to leverage its features like variables and nesting.

- **Additional Files**: The project includes a `src` folder with a structured approach to styling and JavaScript to improve code organization.

These modifications aim to further my understanding and showcase additional skills beyond the scope of the tutorial.
